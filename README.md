# Simple Image Search App

This project was part of job interview task.

## Project goals

Build a simple single page application using [unsplash.com](www.unsplash.com) API.

## Project requirements

Main requirements were to use React and build Search input with which a user could fetch new photos using keywords, minor things like loading and error indicator included.

There were many bonus (optional) things to choose from. I chose to complete this task using React, TypeScript, Material-UI (styles), Redux and JEST testing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
